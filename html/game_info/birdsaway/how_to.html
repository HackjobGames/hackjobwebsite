    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Birds Away is a very simple game. When starting the game, first you will need to select a difficulty. There are four difficulties, and you unlock them as you beat the previous
        difficulty. The controls are simply up, down, left, and right to move, and space bar to poop. You get one point for pooping on normal people and five points for pooping on the illusive golden man
        If you would like to discover the game for yourself, I would suggest you stop reading now because I'm going to spoil all of the game's content.

    <h1>Enemies</h1>
    <p>
        There are a few enemy types within the game. They each have different patterns and properties that you should be aware of.

        <h2>White Bird</h2>
        <p>We don't really have a name for this bird. It's just your bird but white. We aren't artists lol. This bird is pretty basic. They will come from the right side of the screen giving
            you plenty of time to react and move out of the way.
