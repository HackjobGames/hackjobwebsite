    <p>This is the first game that was ever made by HackJob games. First, a little history. Back in the school year of 2018-2019, Grant (Co-Founder) and Dylan (Co-founder), both computer
        science majors in college, wanted to work on a small project to improve thier coding skills. Some dumb idiot (Grant) came up with the idea for a mobile app about a bird pooping on people.
        About a month of coding and making fart noises into a microphone later, Birds Away was born. I made a whole 23 cents on the Google Play store before being taking down for "distributing sensitive
        user information." So after that disaster, they decided to put it on their website for free and never think about it ever again. Not sure if we will ever work on it again, but if you have suggestions
        for how we can improve the game, feel free to contact us at contact@hackjob.games.
