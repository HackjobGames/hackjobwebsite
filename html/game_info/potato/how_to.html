        To fling the potato, simply click and drag anywhere on the screen. Think of it like a sling shot. Let go of the mouse to send the potato flying. Once per level,
        if you click while the potato is in mid-air, you can use a slow down effect for a more accurate shot. Just try to get it in the exposed dirt. That's really it for now.
        This page will hopefully be more fleshed out as we update the game.
