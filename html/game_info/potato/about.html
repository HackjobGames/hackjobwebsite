    <h1>About the Game</h1>
    <p>
        We were working on a physics based 2D platformer with 3D graphics, but that was too hard, so we threw it in the dumpster. We wanted to make a small, fun game 
        that would be a good step up from what we made before. Enter Plant The Potato. A game where you try to fling a potato to plant it. We have a demo out now, and 
        we will be updated regularly in the future.
