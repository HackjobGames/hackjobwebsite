      This site is being developed in the free time of some very busy indivduals, but we are passionate about what we do. 
      First, a little history. Back in the school year of 2018-2019, Grant (Co-Founder) and Dylan (Co-Founder), both computer
      science majors in college, wanted to work on a small project to improve thier coding skills.
      They both love video games, so making a game in Unity seemed like a natural fit. And with that HackjobGames was born.
      I hope you enjoy your time here and feel free to contact us at contact@hackjob.games with any questions.
