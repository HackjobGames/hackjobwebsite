        This site is being developed in the free time of some very busy indivduals, but we are passionate about what we do. 
        First, a little history. Back in the school year of 2018-2019, Grant (Co-Founder) and Dylan (Co-founder), both computer
        science majors in college, wanted to work on a small project to improve thier coding skills.
        They both love video games, so making a game in Unity seemed like a natural fit. And with that HackjobGames was born.
        I hope you enjoy your time here and feel free to contact us at contact@hackjob.games with any questions.
