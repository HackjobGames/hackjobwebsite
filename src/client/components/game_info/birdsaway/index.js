    This is the first game that was ever made by HackJob games. First, a little history. Back in the school year of 2018-2019, Grant (Co-Founder) and Dylan (Co-founder), both computer
    science majors in college, wanted to work on a small project to improve thier coding skills. Some dumb idiot (Grant) came up with the idea for a mobile app about a bird pooping on people.
    About a month of coding and making fart noises into a microphone later, Birds Away was born. I made a whole 23 cents on the Google Play store before being taking down for "distributing sensitive
    user information." So after that disaster, they decided to put it on their website for free and never think about it ever again. Not sure if we will ever work on it again, but if you have suggestions
    for how we can improve the game, feel free to contact us at contact@hackjob.games.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Birds Away is a very simple game. When starting the game, first you will need to select a difficulty. There are four difficulties, and you unlock them as you beat the previous
        difficulty. The controls are simply up, down, left, and right to move, and space bar to poop. You get one point for pooping on normal people and five points for pooping on the illusive golden man
        If you would like to discover the game for yourself, I would suggest you stop reading now because I'm going to spoil all of the game's content.
    </p>
    <h1>Enemies</h1>
    <p>
        There are a few enemy types within the game. They each have different patterns and properties that you should be aware of.
    </p>
        <h2>White Bird</h2>
        <p> 
            We don't really have a name for this bird. It's just your bird but white. We aren't artists lol. This bird is pretty basic appearing in all difficulties.
            They will come from the right side of the screen giving
            you plenty of time to react and move out of the way.
        </p>
        <h2>Woodpecker</h2>
        <p>The woodpecker enemy start appearing in normal difficulty. They appear from the left sid of the screen and are significantly faster than the white bird enemy. Be careful, and try to 
            stick to the middle of the screen so you can react properly.
        </p>
        <h2>Chickadee</h2>
        <p>Watch out for this fat boi. The chickadee enemy first gets introduced in the hard difficulty. It appears from the right side of the screen and bounces from top to bottom as it goes. 
            It has a much larger hitbox than previous enemies, so watch out.
        </p>
    <h1>PowerUps</h1>
        <p>There are three different powerups in the game for you to collect and use. They are all available in all difficulties and provide some fun variation on the normal gameplay flow.</p>
        <h2>Shield</h2>
        <p>The shield powerup does exactly as it says; It give you a shield that will absorb one hit. The shield will stay on your bird until you get hit and they do not stack.</p>
        <h2>Poop Speed</h2>
        <p>This colon cleansing powerup cleans you out real good and allows to poop twice as fast for a short amount of time.</p>
        <h2>Beans</h2>
        <p>This fiber rich powerup allows your bird to unleash a devastating bowl movement on the people below. After obtaining the beans powerup, 
            your next poop will be many time bigger and grosser. I'm sorry about the sound, but I'm not changing it lol.</p>
