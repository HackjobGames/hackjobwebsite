      This is a small project based on a mini game in an old adventure game from forever ago. This was the first project where there was a strict time limit of
      one month imposed. This was we didn't take a full year to complete a game because we kept wanted to add new features.
    </p>,
  howTo:
  <div>
    <h1>Controls</h1>
      <h2>Controller</h2>
        <p>
          Currently this is the only functional way to play the game. After selecting controller on the main menu, press start on a connected controller to join
          the game. Currently Xbox and PS4 controllers are supported. Left analog stick will move which mirror you have selected. A (Xbox) X (PS4) will grab the mirror
          allowing you to move it around with the left stick. Pressing the LB (Xbox) L1 (PS4) will rotate the mirror counter-clockwise and clockwise with the right buttons.
          Right trigger to fire a ball from the selected lane, and use up and down on the D-Pad to select which lane you want to fire in.
        </p>
      <h2>Mouse</h2>
        <p>
          This mode is sort-of functional, but only for one player. There is the posibility of a 1-player mode with and AI being added, but it isn't likely to be soon.
          Left click and drag will grab and move a mirror. Right click will rotate the mirror, and clicking the green arrows on the left will fire a ball from them.
        </p>
    <h1>What We Learned</h1>
      <p>
        This was the first project that we put a strict 1-month time limit on it, and I think it worked very well. I feel like the limit gave more motivation to
        get stuff done while also forcing us to keep the scope of the project small. The next project is planned to have a 2 month time limit, but I don't think
        the time limit should increase each time, and should levitate between 1-3 months. Overall I'm very happy with the project and hope you guys enjoy.
