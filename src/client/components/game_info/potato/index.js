      <p>
          We were working on a physics based 2D platformer with 3D graphics, but that was too hard, so we threw it in the dumpster. We wanted to make a small, fun game 
          that would be a good step up from what we made before. Enter Plant The Potato. A game where you try to fling a potato to plant it. We have a demo out now, and 
          we will be updated regularly in the future.

          To fling the potato, simply click and drag anywhere on the screen. Think of it like a sling shot. Let go of the mouse to send the potato flying. Once per level,
          if you click while the potato is in mid-air, you can use a slow down effect for a more accurate shot. Just try to get it in the exposed dirt. That's really it for now.
          This page will hopefully be more fleshed out as we update the game.
