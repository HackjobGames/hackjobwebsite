      <h1>About the Game</h1>
      <p>
          We were working on a physics based 2D platformer with 3D graphics, but that was too hard, so we threw it in the dumpster. We wanted to make a small, fun game 
          that would be a good step up from what we made before. Enter Plant The Potato. A game where you try to fling a potato to plant it. We have a demo out now, and 
          we will be updated regularly in the future.
      </p>

  howTo:
    <div>
      <h1>Controls</h1>
      <p>
          To fling the potato, simply click and drag anywhere on the screen. Think of it like a sling shot. Let go of the mouse to send the potato flying. Once in the air you
          can double click to enter slow-mo, you can do this once per shot. When in the air you can click and fling the mouse left or right to add some spin.
      </p>
      <h1>Stars</h1>
      <p>
        If you get 20 stars you can move on to the next set of levels, getting all 30 stars for a page of levels, will unlock challenge mode.
        This allows you to replay previous levels and complete new and interesting challenges.
        The game was originally planned to be very long with a lot of levels and challenges, unfortunately we over-extended ourselves for what we were capable of, and ended up
        not finishing everything we originally had planned.

      <h1>What We Learned</h1>
      <p>
        Although this game had a very basic idea behind it, we fell victim to trying to implement more and more features until it ballooned out of control.
        From now on, unless we are planning a comercial project, I think it's best to have strict requirements or a deadline to complete the game. Still I love
        our cute little potato game and hope you do to.
